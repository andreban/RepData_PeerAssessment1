## Loading and preprocessing the data

Unzip the data
```r
    unzip('activity.zip')
```

now load the CSV
```{r}
    data <- read.csv('activity.csv')
    summary(data)
    data$date <- as.Date(data$date)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
aggregated <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, mean)
mean(aggregated$steps)
median(aggregated$steps)
library(ggplot2)
qplot(date, steps, data=aggregated, geom="bar", stat="identity");
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
aggregated <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)
qplot(interval, steps, data=aggregated, geom="line");
```


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r}
    data$day <- weekdays(data$date)
    data$weekday <- data$day != 'sÃ¡bado' & data$day != 'domingo'
    aggregated <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + weekday, data, mean)
    qplot(interval, steps, data=aggregated, geom="line", color=weekday);

```
